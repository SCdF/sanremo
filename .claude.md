# Claude Code Guidelines for Sanremo

This document contains important guidelines for Claude when making changes to this codebase.

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing any code changes, **ALWAYS** run these commands:

### 1. Run Linter
```bash
yarn check
```
This runs Biome to check for:
- Import ordering issues
- Formatting problems
- Code style violations

If there are errors, fix them before committing.

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
yarn test:client --run
yarn test:server --run
```
Or simply:
```bash
yarn test:client --run && yarn test:server --run
```

Ensure all tests pass before committing.

### 3. Verify Both Pass
Only commit when BOTH commands succeed with no errors.

## Why This Matters

- **yarn check**: The build process uses Biome for linting. If linting fails, the CI/CD pipeline will fail.
- **yarn test**: Tests ensure code changes don't break existing functionality.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Full pre-commit verification
yarn check && yarn test:client --run && yarn test:server --run

# If all pass, commit:
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
```

## Import Ordering

This project uses Biome with specific import ordering rules:
- Library imports (like `@testing-library/react`) come BEFORE React
- React import comes AFTER other library imports
- Use semicolons at the end of import statements

Example:
```javascript
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import React from 'react';
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';
```

NOT:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
```
