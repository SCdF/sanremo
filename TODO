Highlight next task to complete in checklist, allow space / enter to complete the task and highlight the next one

Stop item text from being selectable

Create DB init where index creation etc takes place (for now we are not using indexes AT ALL!) 

Spend a pomo looking into shorter and less ugly variations on raw uuids to clean up URLs etc.

Spend a pomo looking into TypeScript with React: a good idea?

Spend a pomo thinking about whether the URL structure for a checklist really needs its template ID as well. This is arguably right from a REST philosophy, but who cares? Why does a checklist need to know its template origins? Are we ever going to take knowledge from a template and apply it to an existing instance? That seems unlikely to me.
