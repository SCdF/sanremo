Quick list

inline edit:
- fix back button behaviour
- generalise migrations

WYSIWYG editor:
- template edited with WYSIWYG
- editing a template from a repeatable, do we need to change anything to make that look seamless now?

Revisit typing. We should have internal types not bound to PouchDB structures that mean the slug against the repeatable are cleanly typed with no ambiguiity.

Move to pnpm because I use it everywhere else.

Spend a pomo looking into shorter and less ugly variations on raw uuids to clean up URLs etc.

For responsiveness, decouple visual actions (checking a box) with writing to DB? Consider it...
- TODO: is this still happening? We aren't binding checkboxes with material design anymore

Questions on completion:
- If you complete all checks in a checklist, should it be automatically marked as completed?
- Should it also be automatically closed?

"Repeatable” is a better name for checklists? Imagine also supporting a "daily mgmt” checklist that lets you increment a counter for every glass of water, generally record your day.
Or "Steps". Maybe that is best name?

Each repeatable has a key that you can search by, e.g. date, or random string (e.g. treeish). This is a field known to the indexer, and appears in the title alongside the name of the repeatable
Each repeatable has a "notes" section that supports markdown at the end

Other input types:

- Text, URL, Date: all can be linked to `key` which can be searched on (see above).
- Counter with max. Starts at 0, hittecklistng space stays on the same el until his max, then moves on.
- Sub lists, when moving into one the outer area dims and once you complete everything inside it, the main checkbox completes (or increments, see above) and collapses, moving on

Work out how to refactor code base to keep concerns together.

- `deleted` means a soft delete. This truth is relied upon in template deletion, and template listing, but they don't learn this from a shared placeholde
- `_id`s are defined and split in various ways, the knowledge of which is spread around
- etc. Maybe have a 'datatype` directory or something?
